This is a basic React app that fetches a list of posts, renders them as a table.<br>
Each row is linked to a page with post and post author information displayed.<br>
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>
Loader styles are from [loading.io](https://loading.io/css/)<br>
Accessible posts rows inspired by [inclusive-components.design](https://inclusive-components.design/cards/#theredundantclickevent)
